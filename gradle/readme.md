When scripts are updated here, it is necessary to delete the .gradle folder of the projects using
them in order to delete the cache and refresh them.

Hint: to speedup Gradle, you can assign it more memory setting the following environment variable
in your .bashrc:

    export GRADLE_OPTS=-Xmx1024m
